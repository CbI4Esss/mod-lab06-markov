Politicians have condemned a suggestion made in a newspaper that Labour's Angela Rayner tries to distract Boris Johnson in the Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Mail on Sunday claimed some unnamed Conservative MPs said she tried to put the PM "off his stride". Ms Rayner dismissed this as a "perverted smear" that showed women in politics faced misogyny every day. A raft of politicians, including women Tory MPs, spoke out in support of her. Conservative Caroline Nokes said too many female MPs of all parties had been "on receiving end of vile articles", while former minister Andrea Leadsom tweeted: "Really sorry Angela. Totally unacceptable comments and reporting." Both Mr Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also criticised the comments, with the PM tweeting: "As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue, I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today."
